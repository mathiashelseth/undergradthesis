This is an initial test program created in C code.

The program simply runs a monobit test on an input file
that contains exactly 20.000 bits. This was created only
to learn more about the test in itself, and to understand
the concepts behind a single test that together with multiple
other tests, make a test suite.

Running this program simply needs a RAW input file from a RNG.
Provide the input file in the positional parameter list when
running the compiled program.

Example: ./monobit_test inputfile
